# Memory-Management

Memory management project for OS course in this project we use URL, second chance, and FIFO algorithms to handle the memory management task we use normal and circular queue to do so and we have a client and server to perform the demanding process.
This program works with the client and server. you can change the port and put yours


# Scheduling Algorithm


- FIFO (First-In-First-Out): This algorithm assigns the table to the new customer based on the order in which the customers arrived. The table that was occupied by the first customer who arrived will be allocated to the new customer.

- LRU (Least Recently Used): This algorithm assigns the table to the new customer based on the least recently used table. The table that was least recently occupied will be allocated to the new customer.

- Second-Chance: This algorithm is a variation of the FIFO algorithm. It considers whether the customer at a table has been "used" or not. If a table has been used (occupied) previously, it gives the customer a "second chance" before reallocating the table to the new customer.
